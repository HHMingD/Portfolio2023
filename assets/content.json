They also realised that their business would require significant uplift in their digital outreach due to their geo-locational constrains. (Far from major markets with global talents)\n\nMost of our work would rely on improvisation as we uncover the potential of VR technology. We developed a method for rapid prototyping. To allow us to use an organic approach for this case. \n\nOur goal is to seek opportunities in building standalone VR products. \n\nI was the metaverse subject matter expert of this project in charge of the research routines and the prototype strategy and the production lead of the case.",

The second phase was to explore the feasibility of building VR based virtual community within our client's core social group (Employees and family).The third use case builds on top of the second phase result. We validated the use case to extend the virtual community concept with a VR onboarding experience for new joiners of our client's community. \n\nThe project extended from originally a 7 weeks project to a project lasting more than an year. It is still an on going project as of now (OCT 2023.) ",
