    "SummaryContent": "Our client is a state-owned investment entity in GSA. \n\nAs this is the first ever sold case for BCG around the metaverse topic, we are in a pioneering role to experiment with the BCG’s metaverse strategy.\n\nThe client have no prior knowledge in the field of metaverse, spatial rendering and digital marketing. They also realised that their business would require significant uplift in their digital outreach due to their geo-locational constrains. (Far from major markets with global talents)\n\nMost of our work would rely on improvisation as we uncover the potential of VR technology. We developed a method for rapid prototyping. To allow us to use an organic approach for this case. \n\nOur goal is to seek opportunities in building standalone VR products. \n\nI was the metaverse subject matter expert of this project in charge of the research routines and the prototype strategy and the production lead of the case.",
    "ImpactContent": "The project was the first ever sold metaverse project for BCG. \n\nWith our strategic input, our client made significant progress on building their own metaverse strategy.\n\nWe’ve had two major pivot during the period of my staffing.\nThe first phase was to explore the VR use case for the family and business setting. The second phase was to explore the feasibility of building VR based virtual community within our client’s core social group (Employees and family).The third use case builds on top of the second phase result. We validated the use case to extend the virtual community concept with a VR onboarding experience for new joiners of our client’s community. \n\nThe project extended from originally a 7 weeks project to a project lasting more than an year. It is still an on going project as of now (OCT 2023.) ",

This is uncharted territory for both BCG and our client. \n\nNo rapid prototyping tools. The time it takes to test a concept is significantly longer comparing to the traditional UI/UX 2D digital project.\nThe project has a short time span initially. we need to put together a convince use case that would help our client’s business in a short 7 weeks sprint.",

        "ActionContent": "We embraced the principal of ”seeing is believing”. We believed that the only way to deliver meaningful insight is to put VR product in front of our testing participants. \n\nUtilised VR mock ups to validate our hypothesis  through user research with a captive user group picked by the client side. \nKey Pivot: Use of the environment of “VRChat” to build quick and dirty VR experiences to test and gather insights, with extremely basic unity build. At time, we focused on simple script, look and feel, and design articulation.\nLook and feel and the necessity of articulating the affordance of the VR design, Designing objects and scene that resonate with the target audience accordingly. \nLeveraging my experience in Spatial rendering, we built 4 different VR scenes to explore the potential VR value with our client.

All the manual tasks make it hard for them to scale, while seeing the demand growing by 3 fold in the past two years\n\nIt has become evident that Words and Excel would not be sufficient to support their future growth. We are tasked to build a B2B product that handles the scoring questionnaire, the customers response system and the E2E scoring journey.\n\nWe need to build a digital journey from the ground up. Demolishing undesirable process and create the new link in their operation. \n\nThis is a behemoth piece of work, we separate the work into many different streams.

The increasing public awareness to the climate crisis has propelled their business to multiply in the past few years.  If they are unable to ride the wave of hyper growth for climate industry, their business would be seriously challenged as the market would favor competitors with better products. \n\nOur work has been success in multiple front. The new product will be able to help our client solve their scaling issue in the short term.
